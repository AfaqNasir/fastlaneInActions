# Motivation

The idea is to build and ship a **React-Native**-App (iOS and Android) with [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) and using [GitHub-Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) to do this.

Or in simpler words: Use GitHub-Actions as a CI for a React-Native-App.

I wanna try to document my way to get this goal here.

So this repository is heavily under constructions (**work in progress**)!
